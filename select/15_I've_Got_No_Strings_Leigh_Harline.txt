I've got no strings
To hold me down
To make me fret, or make me frown
I had strings
But now I'm free
There are no strings on me

Hi-ho the me-ri-o
That's the only way to be
I want the world to know
Nothing ever worries me

I've got no strings
So I have fun
I'm not tied up to anyone
They've got strings
But you can see
There are no strings on me

You have no strings
Your arms is free
To love me by the Zeider Zee
Ya, ya, ya, if you would woo
I'd bust my strings for you

You have no strings
Couci couca
Your savoir faire is oo-la-la
I've got strings but entre nous
I'd cut my strings for you

Down where the Volga flows
There's a Russian rendez-vous
Where me and Ivan goes
But I'd rather go with you, hey!

There are no strings on me!
