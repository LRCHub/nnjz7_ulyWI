I wake up every morning with a smile on my face
Everything in its place as it should be
I start out every morning just as free as the breeze
My cares upon the shelf because I find myself with

No strings and no connections, no ties to my affections
I'm fancy free and free for anything fancy
No dates that can't be broken, no words that can't be spoken
Especially when I am feeling romancy

Like a robin upon a tree, like a sailor that goes to sea
Like an unwritten melody, I'm free, that's me
So bring on the big attraction, my decks are cleared for action
I'm fancy free and free for anything fancy

Like a robin upon a tree, like a sailor that goes to sea
Like an unwritten melody, I'm free, that's me
So bring on the big attraction, my decks are cleared for action
I'm fancy free and free for anything fancy
